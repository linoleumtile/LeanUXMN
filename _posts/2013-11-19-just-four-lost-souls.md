We're going to be having an "open fishbowl" discussion about topics that YOU CHOOSE related to UX and Web Development.
<p>

The fishbowl is a great way for us to gauge this group's interests and skills so we can plan some amazing events for next year. Here's how it works.

Here's how it works. We'll have 5 chairs in the front of the room, with 4 people
seated. This is the fishbowl. One chair is open, hence the "open
fishbowl".

During the meet and greet period, we'll set out some 3"x5" index cards
on which you can offer discussion topics. We'll pre-populate to make
sure we have something to start off with.

Once we get started, we'll
pull from this pile. The four fishies up front will talk for 5 minutes
about the first topic in the stack. If you're in the audience, and you
want to say something, you have to come up and sit in the open chair
-- only people in the fish bowl can talk. When someone comes up,
someone else can sit down.

When the 5 minutes is up (a moderator will be timing), the audience
can choose by a voice vote whether to continue the discussion or move
on to the next topic.

So start thinking about your topics and get ready to get real in the fishbowl tonight!
