title: What we want for the Lean UX community in Minnesota

<p class="lead">We made big changes when we embraced Lean UX. Reducing documentation and increasing collaboration has radically changed how we work within our development teams. We want to create a space for teams in the Twin Cities to share how to get better and faster at what we do.</p>

Joe and I went to the Lean Day UX conference earlier this year because it seemed different. It wasn't the same talks we had seen or heard about. Around the same time, Erik was reading about [Lean UX] [1] and [Lean Startup] [2]. When we got back to Minnesota, we immediately started talking about how exciting some of these lean concepts were.


Co-located teams of UX, Dev, and PMs. Inexpensive but valuable testing techniques. Rapid prototyping while whiteboarding the wireframes. Each talk and section of these books had numerous ways to cut down on excessive documentation and get to the meat of our practice. We began to try out some of these things on various projects in our corporate setting, and it started gaining traction.


We know there's an amazing tech community in Minnesota. We know some of that community has already embraced lean techniques, and that even more teams want to find a way to do that. We're going to start by sharing what we've learned, and then invite the rest of the community to do the same.
